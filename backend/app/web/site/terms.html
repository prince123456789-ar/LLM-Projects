          <h3>1. Agreement</h3>
          <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of RealEstateAI (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

          <h3>2. Accounts and Access</h3>
          <p>You must provide accurate account information and keep it updated. You are responsible for all activity under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials.</p>
          <p>Administrators and managers may create, assign, and revoke access for agents in their workspace. You agree to use role-based access appropriately and not attempt to access data you are not authorized to view.</p>

          <h3>3. Acceptable Use</h3>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Attempt unauthorized access, probing, or exploitation of the Service or its infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Upload malware, abuse the API, or attempt denial-of-service attacks.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to send unlawful, deceptive, or unsolicited messages in violation of platform policies or law.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer or bypass security controls, rate limits, or access restrictions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Integrations</h3>
          <p>The Service may integrate with third-party platforms (messaging channels, email providers, calendars, payment processors). Your use of integrations is subject to the third party's terms and policies. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining proper permissions and complying with platform rules.</p>

          <h3>5. Data and Customer Content</h3>
          <p>You retain rights to the content you submit or ingest into the Service ("Customer Content"). You grant the Service a limited license to process Customer Content solely to provide, secure, and improve the Service as configured by you.</p>
          <p>You represent that you have the rights and permissions necessary to collect, ingest, and process Customer Content (including lead messages and contact details).</p>

          <h3>6. AI and Automation</h3>
          <p>The Service may use automation to extract entities (e.g., budget/location), score leads, route assignments, and generate analytics. Outputs are probabilistic and may contain errors. You are responsible for reviewing outputs before making business decisions.</p>

          <h3>7. Billing</h3>
          <p>Paid plans may be billed monthly. Taxes may apply. Payment processing is handled by third-party providers. Plan limits, pricing, and renewal details will be shown at checkout and in invoices.</p>
          <p>Unless required by law, fees are non-refundable.</p>

          <h3>8. Security</h3>
          <p>We implement security controls such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit logging. You agree to follow security best practices, including using strong passwords and restricting access to your workspace.</p>

          <h3>9. Availability and Support</h3>
          <p>We aim for high availability, but do not guarantee uninterrupted operation. Maintenance, outages, and third-party platform failures can occur.</p>

          <h3>10. Termination</h3>
          <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if required for security or legal reasons.</p>

          <h3>11. Disclaimers</h3>
          <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

          <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenue, or data.</p>

          <h3>13. Changes</h3>
          <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>
