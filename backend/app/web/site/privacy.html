          <h3>1. Overview</h3>
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how RealEstateAI (the "Service") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our website, web application, APIs, and integrations.</p>

          <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email, role, organization/workspace identifiers, authentication data (hashed passwords), and security metadata (session version, device identifiers).</p>
          <p><strong>Lead and conversation data:</strong> messages, contact details, properties requested, budget/location/timeline, channel source, and structured fields created from message parsing.</p>
          <p><strong>Usage and diagnostics:</strong> event logs, audit logs, IP address (where provided by your network), request identifiers, rate-limit events, and performance metrics.</p>
          <p><strong>Billing metadata:</strong> subscription identifiers and customer identifiers from payment processors (we do not store full card data).</p>
          <p><strong>Integration credentials:</strong> tokens and secrets you provide for channels (stored and used to connect your accounts). You are responsible for providing correct credentials and rotating them when needed.</p>

          <h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
          <p>We use information to operate the Service, including: ingesting leads, deduplicating and enriching records, generating analytics, sending follow-ups you configure, scheduling appointments, and producing exports/reports.</p>
          <p>We also use information to secure the Service: fraud prevention, access control, rate limiting, anomaly detection, and incident response.</p>

          <h3>4. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h3>
          <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, processing may be based on contract performance, legitimate interests (security, prevention of abuse), and consent (where you enable marketing or messaging automations).</p>

          <h3>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
          <p>We share information with:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Service providers</strong> that help us host and operate the Service (infrastructure, monitoring, email delivery, payment processing).</li>
            <li><strong>Integration providers</strong> you connect (e.g., messaging platforms) to send/receive messages or events.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal and safety</strong> disclosures when required by law, or to protect rights, security, and users.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not sell personal information.</p>

          <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
          <p>We retain data for as long as needed to provide the Service and comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion of your workspace data subject to contractual and legal constraints.</p>

          <h3>7. Security</h3>
          <p>We use security measures such as hashed passwords, role-based access control, rate limiting, request identifiers, transport security (TLS where available), and audit logging.</p>
          <p>No system can be guaranteed 100% secure. You are responsible for using strong passwords, protecting integration credentials, and restricting workspace access.</p>

          <h3>8. International Transfers</h3>
          <p>Your data may be processed in countries different from where you live, depending on infrastructure providers. Where applicable, we use appropriate safeguards.</p>

          <h3>9. Your Rights</h3>
          <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, delete, or restrict processing of your information. You can contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

          <h3>10. Changes</h3>
          <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
