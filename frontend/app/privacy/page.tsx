        <h3>2. Data We Collect</h3>

        <h3>3. How We Use Data</h3>
        <p className="small">We use data to provide services, secure systems, prevent abuse, support customers, generate analytics, process payments, and meet legal obligations.</p>

        <h3>4. Legal Bases</h3>
        <p className="small">Where applicable, processing relies on contract performance, legitimate interests, legal obligations, or your consent.</p>

        <h3>5. Sharing</h3>

        <h3>6. Retention</h3>
        <p className="small">We retain information only as long as needed for service delivery, dispute handling, security, and legal compliance, then delete or de-identify where feasible.</p>

        <h3>7. Security</h3>
        <p className="small">We apply layered controls including access restrictions, encryption in transit, audit logging, authentication controls, rate limiting, and monitoring. No method is 100% secure.</p>
